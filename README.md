Pyvis
===

Pyvis is a quick experiment in live coding I put together using PyQt &
Scintilla.

It is a fairly simple application, in which the left hand panel accepts some
python code, and then the right hand panel displays an .svg file output by the
code in the left hand panel.  This allows for some interesting experimentation
with .svg producing python code - as you can see the results of your tinkering
almost immediately.

Heavily inspired by the excellent ['Inventing on Principle' by Bret Victor](http://vimeo.com/36579366)

Some basic example python code is contained in the `samples` folder.
